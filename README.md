## Minimum Viable Product

Instashare is a social media platform centered around sharing
interesting photos with friends. It was built with Ruby on Rails
on the backend, utilizing React/flux architecture on the frontend.
Instashare mimics key Instagram functionality, namely the ability
to share photos and create captions. Additionally, you can comment
on and like posts, create tags, tag locations (using geolocation api),
 and subscribe to users to have their posts show up in your feed.
